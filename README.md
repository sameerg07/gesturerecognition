# GestureRecognition
A deep learning based gesture recognition system for Smart TVs

## Problem Statement

Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

* Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
* Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
* Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
* Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
* Stop: Pause the movie

## Final Model:
* MobileNet+GRU with a validation accuracy of 94% and a validation loss of 0.1122
